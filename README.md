# Snake-and-Ladder
## Introduction
This code simulates a two-player Snake and Ladder game in C#. It allows players to take turns rolling a dice, moving their positions on the board, and encountering snakes and ladders that affect their progress.

## Key Concepts
### Random Number Generation: 
The rd() function generates a random number between 1 and 6, simulating a dice roll for player movement.
### Game Logic: 
The main function main() controls the game flow, player turns, position updates, and checks for winning conditions.
### Display: 
The displaychart() function visualizes the game board with player positions and special tiles like snakes and ladders.
## Code Structure
The code consists of functions for random number generation, displaying the game board, and the main game loop handling player movements and interactions with the board.
## Conclusion
This C# code snippet provides a basic implementation of a Snake and Ladder game simulation for two players. It includes functions for dice rolling, player movement, and visualization of the game board. Further enhancements can be made to add more game features, improve the user interface, and handle edge cases for a more robust gaming experience.
